"""Accepted facts on the run log.

The next model prompt is composed of three functions:

1. Append an accepted fact (the engine return, or a placeholder when a
   tool did not run). Pause, retry, and hard halt skip this step.
2. After the kernel step, take ``run.since(snapshot)`` — rows whose
   ``seq`` is new. Parallel returns re-sort the list by id, so a new
   row can land in the middle; ``seq`` does not move with the index.
3. Copy each of those rows into the chat transcript.

A new governance action needs an explicit arm and a test that checks
whether a log row was appended. Do not put vendor prompt JSON in the
kernel.
